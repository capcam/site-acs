          <h2><small><b>Celebrating 200 Participants </b></small></h2>
          <p>In April 2023, the ACED Clinical Research Team welcomed the 200th participant into the ACED Cohort!</p>
          <p>We spoke to Cornelius about his experience of joining the cohort:</p>
          <p><i>"I found out about the ACED Cohort from my partner who was very positive about the experience. It's a great way to help with cancer research so I decided to sign up.</i></p>
          <p><i>"My first appointment went really well, it was a very relaxed atmosphere and I enjoyed the experience, particularly the laptop puzzles!</i></p>
          <p><i>"The whole process was explained thoroughly and I was told how my samples would be processed and stored. It's great to know that my data and samples can be used for cancer research studies, and that by coming back each year they can build up a really valuable resource.</i></p>
          <p><i>"I was surprised but very happy to be the 200th participant, it's great to know you've had so many volunteers! I'd really encourage others to take part as it's nothing to worry about, it's an interesting way to spend a couple of hours and it's also good to have a mini MOT!"</i></p>

          <p>The ACED Clinical Research Team is very proud to announce that there are now over 100 participants in the ACED Cohort. In October 2022, the team welcomed Howard into the ACED Cohort. He said: <i>"I'm happy to be helping and I'm proud of the 99 people before me who have led the way. It is great the ACED Cohort has reached this number so quickly, it shows how many people recognise how important this is.</i></p>
          <p><i>To encourage others to join, I'd say it's a really easy way to help with something which could revolutionise cancer diagnosis and save many people a lot of pain, stress and sadness. You will be made to feel welcome and comfortable throughout."</i></p>
